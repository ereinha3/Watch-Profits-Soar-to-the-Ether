CS 472 Final Code Instructions

Introduction:
To train and tune our model, we tested and edited our code on kaggle.com. We decided to use Kaggle it allowed us
to collaborate simultaneously, worked well as a version control. It additionally included all of the dependencies necessary for our code
to run.

To run on Kaggle or your own machine:
Download the ethdata directory containing the data csv files. Ensure that your filepath for the data files is correct.
The line in the code is "df = pd.read_csv(f'./ethdata/{file}')", please change this filepath to wherever you
have your ethdata directory located.

After completing this step, hitting "Run All" will run the code, displaying the confusion matrix, training the models,
showing accuracies, and finally the graph.

During development we separated much of the code, but for simplicity with our submission we implemented one model per block
of code in the notebook. 

Blocks:
1. (Andrew) Conjoins the data, displays a confusion matrix.
2. (Andrew) Displays a graph of historical Ether data.
3. (Ethan) Creation of the trainArgs class, holds hyperparameters for tuning the model. 
4. (Ethan/Andrew) Functions for parsing the data, time_step days will be used to make a prediction.
5. (Ethan) Defining specific hyperparameters for training the models.
6. (Ethan/Andrew) 1-Feature LSTM model.
7. (Ethan/Andrew) 2-Feature LSTM model.
8. (Ethan/Andrew) BiLSTM model.
9. (Ethan/Andrew) GRU model.
10. (Ethan/Andrew) Graph of models.
